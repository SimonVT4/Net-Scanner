# Net-Scanner
This project is a Python-based network scanner capable of performing TCP, UDP, and ICMP scans on specified hosts. It allows users to scan a range of ports for TCP and UDP, as well as conduct ICMP ping tests with customizable options for the number of pings and timeout duration. The tool is designed to help users easily test network connectivity and detect open or closed ports on a target device. It features comprehensive input validation to ensure only valid data is used, making the scanning process efficient and error-free. Additionally, the ICMP scan uses the system's ping command, providing reliable reachability testing. The scanner is suitable for monitoring network activity.
The tool is highly user-friendly, with robust input validation that prevents errors and guides users through each step, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience. Invalid inputs are detected and corrected on the fly, allowing seamless transitions between different scanning options.
Unauthorized port scanning can be illegal and unethical. Only use this tool on networks you own or have explicit permission to test.
Summary: A powerful and easy-to-use network scanning tool for checking and monitoring network connections, designed to be accessible for users of all experience levels.
